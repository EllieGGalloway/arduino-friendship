# arduino-friendship

This repository combines Arduino coding with standard Jewelbots functionality.

The best way to contribute to this library is to clone it into your /Arduino/Libraries folder on your computer (where your machine gets the board libraries you add to the Arduino IDE). 

Then, any edits you make to the library are immediately testable by adding uploading sketches to your Jewelbots through the Arduino IDE. 

It's that simple! If you have any questions, you can find us in the Jewelbots community forums, or just throw up an issue and we will get back to you!
